# The Project: Password Generator Instructions Create Secure Password

* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
* THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Above is the criteria for the password generator it was neccesary to create the code in Java to complete the actions listed above. At first glance this seemed like a simple task but by no means was this a simple task at all. This takes alot of concepts and variables to be written in order to complete the above tasks. I had originally approached this with a totally different mindstate and a completely different way of writing the code but with alot of research I found this method to be the most effective way of completing the tasks and also understanding how the code was working. 

# Lessons:

The lessons I learned from this assignment are vast. We were given a set HTML and CSS but were expected to create the Java in order to make the password generate as mentioned above. I learned how to use the console log efficiently to test the code that I was writing as seen in generate password 2 (screenshot) I took a screenshot of how I was able to test a for loop with the console log. I learned how to write variables that I later could plug into formulas that would set parameters to generate a password. Also I learned how to loop in a while function that would be used in the set parameters were not met i.e. password length too short or too long. I learned that I can use the variables to be confirmed and not confirmed and then take that data to place into the password. This assignment was not an easy assignment the complexity of the Java code seemed approachable at first but it quickly became in my opinion quite complex. 

# Takeaways:

What I took from this assignment was how hard Java can be and how many ways a simple request can be made difficult. It also showed me that there is more than one way to get the assigment completed a for loop could be used, Math.random needed to be included with Math.floor, I could have done it a completely different way and used sets of arrays and ran those through the variables. I took alot from this assignment and I know this was a simple task that is just one building block to a multitude of possibilites that Java offers. I can now look at a website and inspect the code to see its complexities and admire how it works and one day more fully understand and write the code for complex websites.
