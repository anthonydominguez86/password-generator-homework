Above is the criteria for the password generator it was neccesary to create the code in Java to complete the actions listed above. At first glance this seemed like a simple task but by no means was this a simple task at all. This takes alot of concepts and variables to be written in order to complete the above tasks. I had originally approched this with a totally different mindstate and a completely different way of writing the code originally but with alot of research I found using arrays to be the most efficient method to complete the tasks.
